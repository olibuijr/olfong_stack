## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Automated test creation** - Tests found issues and verified fixes
2. **Admin tests** - Successfully automated the admin order management flow
3. **Manual testing** - Provided complete verification of actual functionality
4. **Parallel approach** - Using both automated and manual testing was effective

### What Could Be Improved
1. **User authentication in tests** - Playwright test auth needs better configuration
2. **Test environment setup** - Could be improved for full automation
3. **Test isolation** - Tests could be more independent

### Recommendations
1. **Fix test authentication** - Would allow full automation of user flow
2. **Add more granular tests** - Break down into smaller, focused tests
3. **Add performance testing** - Measure API response times
4. **Add visual regression tests** - Ensure UI changes are intentional
