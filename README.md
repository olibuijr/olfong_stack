## 🚦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Docker (for PostgreSQL database in development)

### Optional: MCP Integration Setup

For enhanced AI-assisted development, you can set up Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration to allow OpenCode to directly interact with your database, automate browser testing, manage GitHub repositories, and perform advanced file operations.

#### Database MCP (PostgreSQL)
1. **Start the PostgreSQL database**:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

2. **MCP Configuration**: The `opencode.jsonc` file is configured with PostgreSQL MCP server using Bytebase DBHub.

**Benefits:**
- AI can directly query database schemas, tables, and data
- Enhanced code generation with real database context
- Schema-aware suggestions and validations

#### Browser Automation MCP (Playwright)
The `opencode.jsonc` file is configured with Microsoft Playwright MCP server for browser automation.

**Benefits:**
- AI can automate browser interactions and testing
- Web scraping and UI testing capabilities
- Screenshot capture and accessibility analysis
- Form filling and navigation automation

#### GitHub MCP (Repository Management)
The `opencode.jsonc` file includes GitHub's official MCP server for comprehensive repository management.

**Benefits:**
- AI can manage issues, pull requests, and CI/CD workflows
- Repository analysis and code search capabilities
- Automated issue triage and code review assistance
- GitHub Actions workflow monitoring and management

#### Filesystem MCP (File Operations)
The `opencode.jsonc` file includes advanced filesystem operations MCP server.

**Benefits:**

- Background process monitoring and management
- Secure command execution with approval mechanisms
- Access to system tools and development workflows

**Note**: PostgreSQL DBHub, Playwright, Filesystem, and Context7 MCP servers are automatically available when using OpenCode in this project directory. The database MCP runs in read-only mode for safety. The GitHub MCP server is currently disabled and can be enabled by setting `enabled: true` in `opencode.jsonc` and configuring a GitHub Personal Access Token.

#### GitHub Personal Access Token Setup

To enable the GitHub MCP server functionality:

1. **Create a Personal Access Token**:
   - Go to [GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
   - Click "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Select scopes: `repo`, `read:org`, `read:user`, `read:project`
   - Copy the generated token

2. **Configure the token**:
   ```bash
   # Edit the .env file in the project root
   echo "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_token_here" >> .env
   ```

3. **Benefits of GitHub MCP Integration**:
   - Repository management and analysis
   - Issue and pull request handling
   - CI/CD workflow monitoring

```

### Kenni IDP Flow
- Mobile/Web obtains a Kenni `idToken` (OpenID Connect). If integrating directly without a full OIDC flow, you can paste the `idToken` in the login screen during development.
- Frontend calls `POST /api/auth/kenni/login` with `{ idToken }`.
- Backend verifies the token using JWKS and upserts the user with fields: `fullName`, `phone`, `kennitala`, `dob`, `idpSubject`, and stores raw claims.
- Backend responds with our JWT and user object for subsequent API calls.

### Stored IDP Fields
- `kennitala` (Icelandic national ID)
- `dob` (derived from claim or `kennitala`)
- `fullName`
- `idpPhone`
- `idpSubject`, `idpProvider`
- `idpRaw` (raw claims JSON)

### Age Restrictions (Legal Compliance)
- Alcohol (WINE/BEER/SPIRITS): customer must be 20+ years old
- Nicotine: customer must be 18+ years old
- Enforced at cart add/update and at checkout. If age cannot be derived from `dob` or `kennitala`, restricted purchases are blocked.
