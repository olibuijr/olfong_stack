5. **Refund Processing** - Complete refund workflow

### Medium Priority (Important Features):
1. **Error Handling** - Test all error scenarios systematically
2. **Edge Cases** - Stock limits, age restrictions, address validation
3. **Performance** - Load testing for high-traffic scenarios
4. **Security** - SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, authentication bypass attempts
5. **Accessibility** - WCAG 2.1 compliance testing

### Low Priority (Nice-to-Have):
1. **Mobile Testing** - Responsive design verification
2. **Cross-browser** - Firefox, Safari, Edge compatibility
