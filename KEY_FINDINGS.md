# OLFONG STACK - KEY FINDINGS SUMMARY

## Overview

The Olfong Stack is a **production-ready e-commerce platform** with comprehensive end-to-end test coverage using Playwright. Below are the key findings from the codebase exploration.

---

## 1. PROJECT STRUCTURE (EXCELLENT ORGANIZATION)

### Three Main Components:
1. **Backend** (`/backend/`) - Node.js + Express + Prisma
2. **Frontend** (`/web/`) - React + Redux + Vite
3. **Tests** (`/web-tests/`) - Playwright E2E tests

### Architecture Pattern:
- **API-First:** RESTful API with 28 route groups
- **State Management:** Redux Toolkit for centralized state
- **Real-time:** Socket.IO for live updates
- **Localization:** i18next with English & Icelandic

---

## 2. PLAYWRIGHT TEST CONFIGURATION (3 SEPARATE CONFIGS)

### Configuration Files Found:
1. **Root Config** (`/playwright.config.ts`)
   - For multi-machine/distributed testing
   - Base URL: `http://192.168.8.62:3001`
   - All 5 browser types (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Mobile)
   - Full parallelization

2. **Web-Tests Config** (`/web-tests/playwright.config.ts`)
   - Optimized for CI/CD (Firefox only)
   - Base URL: `http://localhost:3001`
   - 2 worker processes for stability
   - Enhanced reporting (HTML + JSON + line)

3. **Web Config** (`/web/playwright.config.ts`)
   - Local development testing
   - All browser types
   - Standard parallelization

### Key Configuration Differences:
```
Root Config:       Uses IP address (192.168.8.62) - network testing
Web-Tests Config:  Uses localhost - CI/CD optimized
Web Config:        Uses localhost - dev testing
```
