2. ⚠️ Notification badge count selector may vary
3. ⚠️ Some discount features may not be fully implemented
4. ⚠️ Payment gateway options need verification

### To Be Addressed
1. Socket.io real-time updates need verification
2. Chat functionality needs WebSocket testing
3. Image upload tests need implementation
4. Advanced filtering options need verification
5. Dark mode testing needs addition

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Resilient Selectors**: Multiple fallback strategies
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Tests continue with partial failures
3. **Clear Logging**: Every action logged for debugging
4. **Data Isolation**: Tests don't affect each other
5. **Performance Awareness**: Timeouts properly set
6. **Language Support**: Tests work in multiple languages
7. **Accessibility**: Tests check for proper semantic HTML
8. **Mobile Testing**: Viewport size testing included
