"Create a PR for the new admin analytics feature"
```

#### 3. CI/CD Monitoring
```
"Check the status of the latest build pipeline"
"Monitor deployment progress to staging environment"
"Review test results from the integration test suite"
```

#### 4. Repository Analytics
```
"Show me the most active contributors this month"
"Analyze code churn in the backend API"
"Check repository health metrics and recommendations"
```

## üìÅ Filesystem MCP Server

**Purpose**: Advanced file operations, code search, and bulk refactoring.

### Code Management Examples

#### 1. Code Search & Analysis
```
"Find all places where the cart state is updated"
"Search for error handling patterns in the API routes"
"Locate all age verification logic across the codebase"
```

#### 2. Refactoring Support
```
"Rename the 'getUser' function to 'fetchUserProfile' across all files"
"Update all import statements for the moved components"
"Replace all instances of the old API endpoint URLs"
```

#### 3. File Organization
```
"Analyze the current component folder structure"
"Suggest improvements to the backend service organization"
"Check for unused files or duplicate code"
```

#### 4. Content Analysis
```
"Find all hardcoded strings that need internationalization"
"Search for security-sensitive patterns like API keys"
"Locate all database queries that might need optimization"
```

## üìö Context7 MCP Server

**Purpose**: Access to latest documentation, API references, and best practices.

### Research & Documentation Examples

#### 1. Framework Documentation
```
"Get the latest React hooks documentation and best practices"
"Research Node.js performance optimization techniques"
"Find Flutter state management patterns for complex apps"
```

#### 2. Library Research
```
"Check the latest Prisma ORM documentation for query optimization"
"Research Socket.IO best practices for real-time features"
"Find Tailwind CSS responsive design patterns"
```

#### 3. Security Guidelines
```
"Get current best practices for JWT token handling"
"Research secure payment processing patterns"
"Find guidelines for input validation and sanitization"
```

#### 4. Performance Optimization
```

- Docker daemon available for Playwright and GitHub MCP servers

### Testing MCP Integration
To verify MCP servers are working:
1. Use OpenCode in this project directory
2. Try queries like "Show me the database schema" (PostgreSQL)
3. Test "Take a screenshot of the web app" (Playwright)
4. Ask "Search for React components" (Filesystem)
5. Query "Get React documentation" (Context7)

## üìà Benefits for E-commerce Development
