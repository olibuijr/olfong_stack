- But the API endpoints didn't return the payment/transaction data
- Customers and admins couldn't see how orders were paid

### ✅ Issue #2: Shipping Options Not Associated With Orders

**Status:** FIXED

**What Was Wrong:**
- Shipping options were stored correctly in database (Store Pickup, Home Delivery)
- Orders referenced shipping options correctly (shippingOptionId field set)

- Frontend couldn't display shipping method name, type, or cost

**What Was Fixed:**
- Added `shippingOption: true` to Prisma queries in all 3 endpoints
- Shipping option data now eagerly loaded

### ✅ Issue #3: Delivery Details Not Displaying Correctly

**Status:** FIXED

**What Was Wrong:**
