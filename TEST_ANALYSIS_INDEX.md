## Recommended Action Plan

### Week 1-2 (Critical Gaps)
- [ ] Create discount-management.spec.ts (30+ tests)
- [ ] Create vat-management.spec.ts (25+ tests)
- [ ] Create payment-gateways.spec.ts (40+ tests)
- [ ] Create receipt-generation.spec.ts (15+ tests)
- **Target:** 120+ new test cases

### Week 3-4 (Error Handling)
- [ ] Add error scenarios to all critical features
- [ ] Test edge cases (stock limits, price rounding, etc.)
- [ ] Concurrent user scenarios
- **Target:** 80+ new test cases

### Week 5-6 (Advanced Features)
- [ ] ATVR integration testing
- [ ] Real-time feature reliability
- [ ] Search and filtering comprehensive
- [ ] Performance testing baseline
- **Target:** 60+ new test cases

### Ongoing
- [ ] Security testing (OWASP)
- [ ] Accessibility testing (WCAG)
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] API integration testing

**Expected Result:** 85%+ test coverage, 500+ total test cases
